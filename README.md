# Some configurations

1. I bootstraped the account and region for cdk

2. Created a github repo where the amplify app will be hosted

3. Created a new github token with the repo and admin:repo_hook permissions

4. Save that token in secret manager as a plaintext secret, save it with the name "github-token"
